                                                <p>The nevus of Ota is a distinctive, congenital, benign, bluish grey pigmented lesion, which usually occurs on one side of face, affecting particularly the skin of eyelids, the cheeks, forehead, scalp, nose and ears. It also involves sclera (white visible part of eye) and conjunctiva. It may appear at birth or at early childhood and slowly increases in size till puberty. Rarely does it appear on both sides of face. It was first described by Ota in 1939. The condition is uncommon in India. It is very rare in male patients.</p><br>

Glaucoma (increase in eye pressure associated with headache) appears in approximately 10% of patients. The most serious but unusual complication is the development of malignant melanoma on pigmented areas.</p><br>

Treatment is given once in 6-12 weeks and it may take anything between 8-12 treatment sessions to achieve 80%-95% reduction in skin pigment. Pigment in eyes (sclera) cannot be reduced by any means

                                        <p>The main goal of treating vitiligo is to improve appearance. Therapy for vitiligo takes a long time-it needs to be continued for 6 to 18 months or more. The choice of therapy depends on the number of white patches; their location, sizes, and activity - that is whether it is spreading to other parts of the body or are stable. Each patient responds differently to therapy, and a particular treatment may not work for everyone. Current treatment options for vitiligo include medical, surgical, and adjunctive therapies (therapies that can be used along with surgical or medical treatments).</p>
