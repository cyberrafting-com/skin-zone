                                                <p>The nevus of Ota is a distinctive, congenital, benign, bluish grey pigmented lesion, which usually occurs on one side of face, affecting particularly the skin of eyelids, the cheeks, forehead, scalp, nose and ears. It also involves sclera (white visible part of eye) and conjunctiva. It may appear at birth or at early childhood and slowly increases in size till puberty. Rarely does it appear on both sides of face. It was first described by Ota in 1939. The condition is uncommon in India. It is very rare in male patients.</p><br>
                                                <p>The main problem is usually cosmetic but different complications may appear. Glaucoma (increase in eye pressure associated with headache) appears in approximately 10% of patients. The most serious but unusual complication is the development of malignant melanoma on pigmented areas.</p><br>
                                                <p>Nevus of OTA can be effectively treated with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Treatment is given once in 6-12 weeks and it may take anything between 8-12 treatment sessions to achieve 80%-95% reduction in skin pigment. Pigment in eyes (sclera) cannot be reduced by any means
